# CoCoDragon-8K-EPROM-Cartridge-CC1-8KEC-0001.1
This is an 8K EPROM Cartridge for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1, 2, 3 and Dragon Data Dragon computers. This was one of the very first things that my nephew created when he was teaching himself electronics and computer design - it works, but could be better. He made and sold about 30 of these almost ten years ago. The design was meant to be as small as possible so as to fit entirely inside the cartridge Program Pak port and was useful for DriveWire or CoCoNet. It uses a 2764 EPROM. Updated to version 0001.1 on 5 May 2019 by "Ankle" Bob and released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/] - there is definitely a lot of room for improvement and "Little John" made many improved versions which will be shared as I get more time to do so.
